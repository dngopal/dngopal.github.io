# Hi! I'm Dev. Welcome to my Website.

I’m a current Stanford student interested in the intersection of technology and healthcare, especially to create a more equitable world. 

In my free time, I love reading (I have a soft spot for fantasy novels!), listening to music, and delving into puzzles/riddles. 

I love meeting new people! Connect with me on [Linkedin]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dev-gopal)) and at devgopal@stanford.edu
