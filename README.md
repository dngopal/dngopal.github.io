# Hi! My name is Dev - nice to meet you!

Check out my personal website at [devgopal.me](https://www.dngopal.github.io) or dngopal.github.io. 

Iâ€™m a current Stanford student interested in the intersection of technology and healthcare, especially to create a more equitable world. 

In my free time, I love reading (I have a soft spot for fantasy novels!), listening to music, and delving into puzzles/riddles. 

I love meeting new people! Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dev-gopal) and at devgopal@stanford.edu
